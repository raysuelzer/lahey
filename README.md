# Jim LaheyGPT Discord Bot

Well, look who's come crawlin' for help. Fine, let me tell you about this piss jug of a Discord bot I created while I was absolutely shitfaced. The liquor was flowin' and somehow, I managed to write this bot that talks like me, Jim Lahey, using the OpenAI API. You type !lahey and the bot'll stumble around with a response like a drunk shithawk or somethin' like that.

Now, listen up, because I'm not takin' any responsibility for this bot, and if you want to use it, it's on you, bud. It's a shitstorm comin', and I don't wanna be anywhere near it.

## 1. Clone the shitpository
First, you gotta get this shitcode onto your greasy computer. Run this here command, you shitweasel:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/raysuelzer/lahey.git
```

Or if you're a lazy shithawk who can't be bothered to use the command line, you can download the zip by clickin' that green "Code" button, you greasy cheeseburger walrus.

## 2. Install that Node shit

You need Node.js on your machine, and if you don't have it, you're dumber than Randy's cheeseburger locker. Go to the official Node.js website and get the latest LTS version or whatever.


## 3. Make a damn .env file, you shitapprentice
In the root folder of the project, create a new file named .env. Throw in the following content, and try not to fuck it up:

```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY
```
And for the love of liquor, don't go sharin' your tokens or API keys with others like a shittornado.

Now, you might be wondering where to get your shitokens. I can only lead a shithorse to the shitriver:

[Getting a discord bot token](https://discord.com/developers/docs/getting-started)  I'm too shitfaced to explain this shit. So, use your shitfingers and look shit up.

[Open AI Api Key sign up](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) OpenAI may give you free credits since you're as broke as Ricky after his latest shittastic plan.


## 4. Install those shitpendencies
Open up your terminal or command prompt thingy, go to the project folder, and type this like a shitninja:

```bash
npm install
```

## 5. Get the bot runnin', you shitbird
You got two options to get this bot up and runnin' like a shitmobile, but I don't care which one you choose:

### a) Start the bot
If you wanna fire up this shitstorm of a bot right away, like a shithawk takin' flight, just type this

```bash
npm start
```

### b) Build and run the bot
Or, you can build the project first and then run the built files, if you're one of those fancy shits:

```
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

There you go, assuming you figured out how to get the URL to invite this shitapp into your shitserver, your Lahey bot should be runnin' now, stumbling around like a drunk shithawk in a shiticane.  Now, leave me alone, I got drinkin' to do, and remember, when you're dealing with the liquor, you can't lose.
